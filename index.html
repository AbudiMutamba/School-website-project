But the late Catholic Archbishop Joseph Kiwanuka had a vision and saw it necessary to establish a girl’s secondary school in Rakai District. Thus, Christ the King Secondary School was born. It was established in 1954 at Kasabbaale in Villa Maria Parish. In 1956 the school was shifted to its current premises at Bulinda Hill, Matale Parish, Kalisizo.</p>
